# About Econometric-Utils
A repository of useful "handmade" functions for econometric analysis. Most of these functions come from courses in gradaute econometrics and statistics that require handwriting all "high-level" functions, i.e. maximum liklihood estimations, GMM, instrumental variable regressions, demeaning, propensity score matching etc.

Notice, this is a work in progress and I will continually add to this as I write new functions and rediscover old functions that I have written.
